App includes out-of-the-box:
- Database (Postgres), ORM and migrations (Sequel)
- Key-value database
- Background processing (Sidekiq) with web UI (SidekiqUI)
- Schedules for background workers (Sidekiq-scheduler)
- Background Workers statistic (Sidekiq-statistic)
- multiple environments (production, development, test)
- Rake tasks for general tasks such as migrate db etc..
- Docker-compose file to quickly run the whole app in isolation
- Console action logging (colorized for better readability)
- Locales that contains your telegram message parts and can be easily changed to other locale file
- Preapred test environment (using RSpec by default)
- Trailblazer-operation gem by default to write service objects with business logic

## Requirements
Please keep in mind that you have to install `redis` and `postgres` on your local machine
On just use docker. Docker-compose file included

## Preparation and obtaining an API key
First of all you need to create your own telegram bot and obtain an API key. Follow this steps, it's very simple and will take less than 5 mins:
1. Open telegram and find user '@botfather' in search
2. Press 'Start' button to begin conversation
3. Choose command '/newbot'
4. Enter desired name of your future bot (for instance 'SushiDeliveryBot')
5. Enter desired username (for instance 'sushi_delivery_bot')
6. Save obtained API key. You will set ENV variable with this key later
7. You should to set inline mode and turn off privacy mode for your bot. Inline mode will allow you to use inline keyboards and inline queries. Disabled privacy will allow you to sync user messages to DB. Find this settings in bot settings (@BotFather)

## Setup and first run
1. Create a copy of `.env.example` file and name it `.env`
2. Open `.env` file and set ENV variables

```
# Telegram settings
# (write to '@get_any_telegram_id_bot' if you dont know your id)
TELEGRAM_APP_OWNER_ID= /insert your personal telegram id/ 
TELEGRAM_APP_OWNER_USERNAME= /write your telegram username/
```

4. Run command `bin/setup`
5. Run `bin/%bot_bin_file% to start bot
6. Write `/start` message to your bot in telegram and see output in console
